Verbose logging
---------------
base/Exchange.js fetch()
base/Exchange.js handleRestResponse()
  origin: calls console.log()
  patch: base/Exchange.js: add this.verboseLogger, call that in same place
         also disables "details" explanation in logging
js/bitfinex.js sign()
  patch: log query params before they are encoded into header

Nonce
-----
In base/Exchange.js
origin: uses second() or millisecond(), no guarantee of uniqueness/monotonicity
patch: use millisecond() but increment until > previous
Used for: Binance, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniex.

Symbol names
------------
BCH|BCC, QTM|QTUM, IOT|IOTA
origin: BCH is preferred code for Bitcoin Cash
        commonCurrencyCode() handles BCC|BCH, XBT|BTC
        bitfinex.js handles DSH, QTM, IOT, DAT, including in fetchBalance() etc
        bittrex.js handles BCH|BCC
        liqui.js handles BCH|BCC
patch: no changes, handle any exceptional cases outside of ccxt

Liqui "no orders" response
--------------------------
origin: throws error if error='no orders'
patch: edit liqui.js handleErrors() to tolerate

Binance URLS
------------
Change from www.binance.com to us.binance.com everywhere.
9/8/2018: Reverted as test, no longer any diff.

Binance fetchTickers()
----------------------
Default implementation filters out ticker data for symbols not requested.
This can cause arby to repeatedly poll fetchTickers() on startup.
Easiest solution: do not filter.

Bibox fetchTickers()
--------------------
Default implementation filters out ticker data for symbols not requested.
This can cause arby to repeatedly poll fetchTickers() on startup.
Easiest solution: do not filter.

Bibox fetchMyTrades()
---------------------
Added parseMyTrade() for fetchMyTrades().
Fix baseid and quoteid handling (problem arose with BCHSV).
Use this.commonCurrencyCode (problem arose with BCHSV).

Huobi api config
----------------
Added entry for query/deposit-withdraw.
9/8/2018: Now master has this, no longer any diff.

Huobi URLs
----------
Previously: Change huobipro.com => huobi.pro
Reverted: Back to huobipro.com. Often saw periods (many minutes long) of all REST requests (including order placement) timing out on huobi.pro.
9/8/2018: Now master has huobi.pro, no longer any diff.

Poloniex
--------
Add 'returnOrderStatus' endpoint to list in poloniex.js.
